    "1. Assume a random rectangular petri dish of ```N``` locations wide and ```M``` locations tall (e.g. 90 x 45).\n",
    "1. Assume that each location on the board is given three (3) different types of antibiotics which each can have continuous values from min to max (e.g. 0 to 1).\n",
    "1. Assume that bacteria on the board do not move. \n",
    "1. Assume each bacteria has a genome sequence of three genes of continuous number (e.g. 0 to 1) that provide immunity to the antibiotics. Each gene will correspond to one of the antibiotic elements deposited on the petri dish\n",
    "1. Assume that at each iteration of the simulation each bacteria can randomly copy itself once to a random neighboring empty cell (up, down, left, or right). \n",
    "1. Assume that during the copy there is a chance of mutating each gene (randomly selecting a new value between zero and one) by some mutation rate (e.g. 20%). \n",
    "1. Assume that a bacteria will \"die\" if the value of it's gene does not contain resistance to any one of the three antibacteria. For example, if the gene is a number less than the value of it's corresponding antibiotic it will die.\n",
